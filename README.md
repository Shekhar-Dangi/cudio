# Cudio

Cudio is an MP3 music player where users can upload their audio and lyrics files (LRC files) to enjoy songs with synchronized lyrics. Currently, it is a frontend project, but I will soon be adding the backend functionality. Once the backend is integrated, synced lyrics files uploaded by users will be accessible to everyone.

## Installation

Open index.html file on your browser.

## Features

- Upload your audios files
- Upload custom synced lrc files
- Listen to songs with synchronized lyrics
